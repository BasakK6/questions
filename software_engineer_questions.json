    "title": "How would you explain concepts like polymorphism and inheritance to a computer science student?",
    "answer": "Interviewers ask this question to assess your ability to explain technical concepts.\n\nSample Answer: Let's start with the concept of inheritance:\n\nInheritance:\nInheritance is a fundamental object-oriented programming concept that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class). The subclass can extend or specialize the functionalities of the superclass while reusing its common attributes and methods. This promotes code reuse, modularity, and the hierarchical organization of classes.\n\nKey Points about Inheritance:\n\n1) Superclass and Subclass: The class from which properties and behaviors are inherited is called the superclass or base class. The class that inherits these properties and behaviors is called the subclass or derived class.\n2) Inherited Members: Subclasses inherit all non-private members (fields and methods) of the superclass. This includes instance variables, methods, and sometimes constructors.\n3) Access Modifiers: The access modifiers (e.g., public, private, protected) determine which inherited members can be accessed from the subclass. Public members are accessible to any class, protected members are accessible within the class and its subclasses, and private members are only accessible within the class itself.\n4) Overriding: Subclasses have the ability to override (modify) the implementation of methods inherited from the superclass. This allows the subclass to provide its specific implementation while preserving the method signature.\n\nNow let's discuss polymorphism:\n\nPolymorphism:\nPolymorphism is another crucial concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables a single interface to represent multiple types of objects, promoting flexibility and code reuse.\n\nTypes of Polymorphism:\n\n1) Compile-time (Static) Polymorphism: This type of polymorphism is achieved through method overloading and operator overloading. Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists, while operator overloading lets you define custom behaviors for operators (e.g., +, -, *).\n2) Run-time (Dynamic) Polymorphism: This type of polymorphism is achieved through method overriding. Method overriding allows a subclass to provide its specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. During runtime, the appropriate method implementation is selected based on the actual type of the object.\n\nKey Points about Polymorphism:\n\n1) Code Flexibility: Polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes in a unified manner. This flexibility simplifies code maintenance and promotes scalability.\n2) Late Binding: In run-time polymorphism, the method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object. This is also known as late binding or dynamic binding.\n3) Common Interface: Polymorphism is often achieved through a common interface or abstract class that defines the contract for the methods. Subclasses provide their own implementations while adhering to the interface.\n\nIn summary, inheritance allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, while polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, providing code flexibility and reusability. Together, these concepts form the foundation of object-oriented programming and facilitate the creation of efficient and maintainable software systems.",
